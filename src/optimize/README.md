# Optimizing the datasets

The input dataset optimized were listed as below:

- Penn World Table version 10.0.csv
- Fossil fuel production BP & Shift (2022).csv
- World Inequality Database (WID) - Pretax income.csv
- owid-energy-data.csv

[optimized.js](https://github.com/josephricafort/mvtec-dataviz-project-group1-v2/blob/main/src/optimize/optimize.js) is the main js script involved in the processing

The output optimized files were placed in the [output folder](https://github.com/josephricafort/mvtec-dataviz-project-group1-v2/tree/main/src/optimize/output) and they were named as follows:

- ffRenData.json
- trendData.json

The output optimized datasets were then used for Area and Line charts for the [final story](https://mvtec-dataviz-project-group1-v2.vercel.app/).
